/Users/rupeshpoojary/Drive/Projects/Resume Scorer/test_timelogs.py:19: UserWarning: Calling a `list()` method without specifying `get_all=True` or `iterator=True` will return a maximum of 50 items. Your query returned 50 of 432 items. See https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/v7.0.0/api-usage.html#pagination for more details. If this was done intentionally, then this warning can be supressed by adding the argument `get_all=False` to the `list()` call.
